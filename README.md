# Unofficial typst template
for computer science and data science at Georg-August University Göttingen

## Why?

> Typst is like LaTeX but simpler, easier, faster, smaller, based on 40 years of experience but without 40 years of technical decisions. With a syntax reminiccent of Markdown, you can get going within minutes, without much learning nor painful debugging.

Our goals with this template are simple:

- Make writing a thesis fun and easy.
- Get you going immediately. No lengthy onboarding and no cleaning up later.
<!-- - Provide a drop-in replacement for the existing LaTeX templates from the university. -->
- Drop-in replacement: Mimic the look and feel of existing templates. Our experience is: Your supervisors won't notice, nor should they care!
    - The `legacy` preset mimics [the official template from the CS institute](https://uni-goettingen.de/de/626775.html). This is optimized for double-sided printing.
    - The `modern` present loosely mimics [this group's template](https://hps.vi4io.org/teaching/ressources/start). It is optimized for screen reading.
- Keep everything hackable / fixable. It's your thesis after all. Unlike LaTeX, fixing stuff is quite reasonable.
    - Note: You don't HAVE TO care! Just ignore everything in `lib/` and be happy.
- Stand-alone and archivable: Your thesis repo should include everything to reproduce your thesis as you wrote it.

We found that forking this repo is a better workflow than the official typst library and template structure. 
We don't plan to publish this template as a typst library + template. Typst libraries are not editable (without forking/copying) and one-shot documents like theses profit little from versioned libraries and their archivability is harmed by external dependencies.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo. clone your fork
2. Run `make dev`
3. Open `main.typ` in your favorite text editor. Change something, save and `main.pdf` should automatically refresh.

A very convenient setup is VSCodium + [Tinymist Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/myriad-dreamin/tinymist).
